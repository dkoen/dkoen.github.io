collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2012-05-01-polarization-in-arcsecond-quasars
excerpt: 'The quasar 3C345 displays a seemingly singular 35 degree twist in the polarization of its kiloparsec-scale jet. Because of the vast number of quasars known, it seems unlikely that 3C345 is alone in this respect.'
