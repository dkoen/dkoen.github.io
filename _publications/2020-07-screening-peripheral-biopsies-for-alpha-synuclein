excerpt: 'This work is first to demonstrate the practical utility of an CNN for screening for LTS, which can further translate into a practical screening tool facilitating the antemortem diagnosis of PD. We further plan to develop neural networks for accurate and precise detection and quantification of LTS in antemortem SMG biopsies. This, altogether, would offer a screening, confirmatory, prognostic, and quantitative tool for clinical assessment of early PD.'
