I am a student at [Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://einsteinmed.edu/) (expected MD 2024) and a recent graduate of the Certificate in Premedical Sciences program of Columbia University (in the city of New York). I am interested in the application of mathematics and technology to medicine and am a current research assisstant in the [Crary Lab](http://www.crarylab.org/home.html) at Mount Sinai studying applications of machine learning in neuropathology. I have previous research experience in Combinatorics and Astrophysics. I worked as a software engineer in scalable data infrastructure at a native advertising start up called [Triplelift](https://triplelift.com/). I also write poetry, music, and short stories.
