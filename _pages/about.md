I am a recent graduate of the Certificate in Premedical Sciences program of Columbia University (in the city of New York). I am interested in the application of mathematics and technology to medicine. I have previous research experience in Combinatorics and Astrophysics. I worked as a software engineer in scalable data infrastructure at a native advertising start up called, Triplelift. I also write poetry, music, and short stories.
