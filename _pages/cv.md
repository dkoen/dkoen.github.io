Work experience
======
* January 2019 - Present: Research Assistant, Neuropathology Brain Bank, Icahn Medical School 
  * Applied Attention Assisted Multiple Instance Learning to Complex Datasets to Discern Post-hoc Regions of Interest 
  * Organized data labeling effort as part of a project to build an AI to identify Î±-synuclein deposits funded by the MJFF 
  * Assisted in the Development of a Novel Attention Assisted Multiple Instance Classifier Using Graph Neural Networks 
  * Built a Segmentaiton Model using Hypercube Representations of Whole Slide Images 
  * Pursued Several Certificates in Machine Learning from Coursera 
    * [Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/CQRYD3S4CNCM) 
    * [Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/8JHMSL8FJ2N4)
    * [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/R39SY5M7RPUR) 
    * [AI for Medical Diagnosis](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/EJG9LGXCYGUF) 

* January 2016 - January 2017: Software and Data Infrastructure Engineer, TripleLift 
  * Helped to build current data infrastructure using Spark, Kafka, ZooKeeper, 
  Amazon EMR, DataBricks, MySQL, and Redshift
  * Built reporting to help automate error detection and malformed data. 
  * Worked with Data Science team to assist in model building  
  * Co-Lead initiative to hire interns for all engineering related departments 

* January 2015 - September 2015: Software Engineering Intern, TripleLift 
  * Backend software engineer in Java and Data Scientist. 
  * Worked closely with MySQL and Redshift databases as a backend engineering for 
  the data pipeline. 
  * Investigated discrepancies and automated discrepancy detection. 
  * Worked on Java high performance optimization and utilized data to improve 
  technologies. 
  * Rearchitectured the way data are stored and deleted from the database to deal 
  with issues of scale.

* May 2013 - September 2013: Summer Student Researcher, Brandeis University 
  * Worked in Combinatorial research at Brandeis University where undergraduate mathematics research positions were previously not offered by reaching out to the department and applying for grants. Proved various extensions of the Graph Minor Theorem (Robertson & Seymour 2004) more pertinent to research in Computer Science and learned to use LaTeX and IPE to write academic research papers.
  
* May 2012 - May 2013: Advanced Lab Assistant, Radio Astronomy / Fourier Analysis, 
Physics, Brandeis University 
  * Analyzed data from recent experiments done with the Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array using Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) and Difmap.
